                0 or 1.

    Definition: Interpretation

    and
    or
    not
    implies (→) can be represented by (-x or y)
    equivalence(⇔) can be represented by ( (x and y) or (-x and -y) )
    exclusive or(XOR) can be represented by ( -[(x and y) or (-x and -y)] )
    not and (NAND) can be represented by (-[x and y])
    nor or (NOR) can be represented by (-[x or y])

    NOTE: Consider X XOR Y = Z, then Z XOR Y = X.

    0x42 = 0b 0100 0010
    0x13 = 0b 0001 0011


        After XOR = 0b 0101 0001

        After XOR with 0x13 = 0b 0100 0010 = 0x42

    NOTE: For two inputs can have 2^4 = 16 functions.
