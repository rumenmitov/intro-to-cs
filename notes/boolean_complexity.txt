** Quine McClusky Algorithm

    1) Find all impllicants (from truth table)
    2) Combine non-prime implicants until there are only prime implicants
        - classify and sort the positive literals
        -- compare one-positive literals with two-positive literals , n with n+1 literals and so on
        NOTE: we don't compare elements of same group because we know they will differ
    3) Eliminating non-prime implicants

    NOTE: comaprisons can differ only by 1 (hence max 1 '-')

    *m_1  001  → m_1,5  -01  NOTE: cannot continue comparing because m_1,5,7 the '-' doesn't match and the same for m_4,5,7
    *m_4  100  → m_4,5  10-

    *m_5  101  → m_5,7  1-1
    *m_7  111  → no group to compare with

    NOTE: * means implicant has been used, whatever hasn't is a prime
    NOTE: in the second comparison, nothing has been used, so all three are primes
    
    Implicants m_1 m_4 m_5 m_7
    Prime implicants m_1,5 m_4,5 m_5,7 


    Finding essential primes (when a prime does not appear in any column):

        | m_1,5 | m_4,5 | m_5,7
    ----+-------+-------+------
    m_1 |   x   |       |  
    m_4 |       |   x   |   
    m_5 |   x   |   x   |   x
    m_7 |       |       |   x
         essential
         for m_1   
                
                essential 
                for m_4    

                         essential
                         for m_7

    No essentials here, so find the minimal coverage
    

    F = m_1,5 + m_4,5 + m_5,7 = (¬B ∧ C) ∨ (A ∧ ¬B) ∨ (A ∧ C)
                              = ¬B ∧ (A ∨ C) ∨ (A ∧ C) → not allowed because it has turned to CNF





    NOTE: F has more truths → DNF will be longer, and vice versa
