* Boolean Functions and Formulas

    Definition: A boolean expression is

    Definition: A boolean function, f, is any function of the type
                f:B^k→B, where k ≥ 0.

    → 0, 1            → boolean constants (either 0 or 1), k = 0
    → X, Y, Z         → boolean variables B^1
    → ¬A              → boolean expression
    → F(X, Y, Z, ...) → boolean function


    NOTE: We will have (2^k)-rows in the truth table.

    ** Syntax of boolean formulas

        NOTE: 0 + 1 is syntactically not a Boolean formula.
        NOTE: 0 or 1 is syntactically not a Boolean formula, missing parenthesis.
        NOTE: (x_1 or x_2 or x_3) is syntactically not a Boolean formula, only two variables can be evaluated at a time.
        NOTE: (-0 or 1) is syntactically a boolean formula, since -f is a valid Boolean formula.

    ** Semantics of boolean formulas
        1a -> interpretation of boolean expression is assigned a boolean value
        NOTE: I* is the interpretation of the boolean formula

    ** Example

        F(X, Y, Z) = ((X ∧ Y) ∨ (X ∧ ¬Z) ∨ (Z ∧ ¬0))

        How many rows? 2^3 = 8
        
        G(X, Y, Z) = X ∨ Z

        F ⇔ G when their truth tables match


        | X | Y | Z |   |  Result |
        ----+---+---+---+---------|
        | 0 | 0 | 0 | 
        | 0 | 0 | 1 |
        | 0 | 1 | 0 |
        | 0 | 1 | 1 |
        | 1 | 0 | 0 |
        | 1 | 0 | 1 |
        | 1 | 1 | 0 |
        | 1 | 1 | 1 |

        NOTE: Each row is an interpretation.
