    Definition: A proposition is a statement that is either true or false.

    Definition: An axiom is a proposition that is taken to be true.

    Definition: Peano axioms for natuaral numbers:
        1. 0 is a natural number
        2. Every natural number has a successor
        3. 0 is not a successor of any natural number
        4. If the successor of x equals the successor of y, then x = y
        5. If a statement is true for the natural number 0, and it is true for a 
           natural number, then it is also true for the successor of that number,
           then it is true for every natural number

    Definition: An important true proposition is called a theorem.

    Definition: A lemma is a preliminary true proposition useful for providing
                userful fo proving theorems.

    Definition: A corollary is a true proposition that follows in just a few
                logical steps from a theorem.

    Definition: A conjecture is a proofless proposition, which is believed to be
                true.

    Definition: A predicate is a statement that may be true or false depending on
                the values of its variables. 

    Definition: A mathematical proof is a proposition of logical deductions from
                a base set of axioms that concludes with the proposition in question.

    Proof Techniques:
        - Derivation (P ⇒ K)
        - Contrapositive (P ⇒ Q by ¬Q ⇒ ¬P)
        - Equivalences (P ⇔ Q by P ⇒ Q and Q ⇒ P)
        - Cases
        - Contradiction (¬P is false ⇒ P is true)
        - Induction
