* Relations
   
   Definition: A relation is a subset of the Cartesian Product of the sets
               which it covers.

   NOTE: A k-ary relation is defined over X_1 x X_2 x ... x X_k
   |
   -> e.g. unary is over X_1
   -> e.g. binary is over X_1 x X_2

   NOTE: Relations can be grouped:
            - X_1 x X_2 x X_3 = X_1 x ( X_2 x X_3 )
            - ( X_2 x X_3 ) is a tuple

   Definition: A binary relation, R, of A x B. A is domain of R, B is codomain.
               Subset A x B is called graph of R.

   Definition: The inverse of binary relation R is the relation R^(-1) of B x A.

   NOTE: b R^(-1) a ⇔ a R b

   Definition: The image of a binary relation is the set of the codomain B of R,
               that are related to set A.

   Definition: The range of a binary relation is the set of elements in 
               domain A that relate to at least one element in B.
   |
   -> e.g.
        
        Domain: A = { a, b, c }
        Codomain: B = { 1, 2 }

        Cartesian Product A x B = { (a, 1), (b, 1), (c, 1),
                                    (a, 2), (b, 2), (c, 2) }

        |A| = 3, |B| = 2

        R = { (a, 1), (c, 1) } is a subset of A x B

        Image of R = { 1 }
        Range of R = { a, c }

    Definition: An endorelation is a relation on one set.

    Properties of Endorelations:
    - Reflexive
    |
    -> (a, a) ∈ R

    - Irreflexive 
    |
    -> (a, a) ∉ R

    - Symmetric 
    |
    -> (a, b) ∈ R ⇒ (b, a) ∈ R

    - Asymmetric 
    |
    -> (a, b) ∈ R ⇒ (b, a) ∉ R

    - Antisymmetric 
    |
    -> ( (a, b) ∈ R ∧ (b, a) ∈ R ) ⇒ a = b

    - Transitive 
    |
    -> ( (a,b) ∈ R ∧ (b, c) ∈ R ) ⇒ (a, c) ∈ R

    - Connected
    |
    -> ( (a, b) ∈ R ∨ (b, c) ∈ R ) ⇒ a = b

    - Serial
    |
    -> ∃b | (a, b) ∈ R


    Definition: An equivalence relation is when a relation is reflexive,
                symmetric and transitive.

    Definition: A partial order is when a relation is reflexive, antisymmetric
                and transitive.

    Definition: A strict partial order is when a relation is irreflexive, asymmetric and transitive.

    Definition: A linear order is a partial order if all elements are comparable.

    
    Let S = { a, b, c } and let R_i ⊆ S x S be a set of endorelations over
    S with i ∈ N.

    Reflexivity:
        R_11 = { (a, a), (a, b), (c, c) } -> not reflexive
        R_12 = { (a, a), (a, b), (c, c), (b, c) } -> not reflexive
        R_13 = { (a, b) } -> irreflexive

    Symmetry:
        R_21 = { } -> symmetric, asymmetric, antisymmetric
        R_22 = { (a, b), (b,a), (b, c) } -> not symmetric, not asymmetric, not antisymmetric ((a, b), (b, a) -> shouldn't show up as flipped pairs)
        R_23 = { (a, b), (a, c), (b, c), (a, a), (b, b) } -> not symmetric, not asymmetric (because of (a, a) and (b, b)), antisymmetric

    Transitivity:
        R_31 = { (a, b), (c, a), (a, c), (b, c) } -> not transitive (because of (c, a))
