* Sets
  
    Definition: A set is a collection of distinct objects.
    |
    -> sets have no order
    -> no duplication e.g. {a,b,c} = {b,a,a,c}

    Relations of sets:
    - Equality
    - Subset
    - Proper subset
    - Superset
    - Proper superset

    Operation on sets:
    - Unions
    - Intersections
    - Differences
    - Powersets -> a set of all the possible subsets of a set 
                   (includes the actual set itself as well as the empty set)
    |    
    -> P({}) = { {} }
    -> P(P({})) = { { {} }, {} }
    - Cartesian Product
    |
    -> {} x {} = {}
    -> {}
    -> {} x N = {}, cannot create any tuples since non elements in empty set

    Definition: A is a finite set, the cardinality of A, |A|, is the number
                of elements in A.

    Definition: A set A is countably infinite if there is a bijection f:A->N.

    -> NOTE: We know ∀n∈ℕ has a successor (Peano axioms).

    Definition: A set is countable if it is finite or countably infinite.
