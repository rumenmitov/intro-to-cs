* Structural Induction

    e.g. ancestor tree

    Given ancestor tree covering g generations. What can we say about the number n
    of people in the tree?

    n <= 2^g - 1, less than or equal to since we might not know the full tree

    Proof: We prove that the number of persons in an ancestor tree over g generations
           includes at most 2^g - 1 persons.

       * Base case:

         We have an ancestor tree with a single person (n = 1) which is g = 1
         generation deep.

         n <= 2^g - 1
         ⇒ 1 <= 2^1 - 1 = 1 true

       * Induction step:

         Assume we have an ancestor tree for which n_a <= 2^g_a - 1 holds, and another
         ancestor tree for which n_b <= 2^g_b - 1 holds as well.

         Let m = max {g_a, g_b} (NOTE: max is worst case because the more 
         generations there are, the higher n is). With that we assume that

         n <= 2m - 1

         holds. We consider the case m + 1:

         n <= (2^m - 1) + (2^m - 1) + 1, we are using the upper bound 
                                         (i.e. the max possible value, 
                                         when g_a = g_b)

            = 2 * (2^m - 1) + 1
            = 2 * 2^m - 2 + 1
            = 2^(m + 1) - 1


       ∴ It follows by induction that an ancestor tree extending over g generations
       contains at most 2^g - 1 persons.
