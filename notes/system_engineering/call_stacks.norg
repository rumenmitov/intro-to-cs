* call stacks

A call stack holds a stack frame for every active function call, it must store memory for:
- return address 
- 2
- 3

A function prologue is a sequence of machine instructions at the beginning of a function
  that prepare the stack and the registers for use in the function.

A function call epilogue us a sequence of machine instructions at the end of a function, that restores the
  state before the function call.
